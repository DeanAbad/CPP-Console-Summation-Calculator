#### About Making It
I made this program after I had the idea of visualizing a summation of some values from a math homework I got;
There are few items I noticed where the factorial notation seems wrong, i.e. instead of <i>n!</i> they were
written as <i>!n</i>.

It turns out that they are valid as there are things called <i>subfactorial</i> and <i>derangement</i>, and I
did my homework with its formula which involves a summation.

I am too lazy to write its process here but who I am to write? I only understand it barely.

Anyways, I did finished it and felt good with the accomplishment which implies that I finally have done something
challenging and engaging, not some yet another dull, forced experience, and because of that my curiosity got
reignited a little, somehow, and got the better of me to code the same formula I used.

However, since it has a lot of steps, I only started with this one, and it is also to test whether if I can
still write a program after a long hiatus that is influenced by my internal conflicts and anxiety.

Programming really feels great if it is not forced, and genuinely looks like a hobby than a responsibility or
work.
